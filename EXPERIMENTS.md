# Experiments log

## Protocol

- **Run A (bare)**: `npm run run:quick -- --run-id=run-a-bare-v4`
- **Run B (coordinated)**: `npm run run:quick:coordinated -- --run-id=run-b-coordinated-v4`
- **Serial minimal loop**: `npm run run:serial -- --quick --run-id=run-a-serial-quick`
- **Compare**: `npm run compare -- runs/run-a-bare-v4/metrics.json runs/run-b-coordinated-v5/metrics.json`

## Runs (2026-07-24) — composer planner re-run

| Run ID | Mode | Coordination | planner | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| run-a-bare-v4 | quick, concurrency 2 | false | **llm** | **24.2%** pass (127/525), 0 merge/scope, 463 LOC, 3/3 tasks, ~22 min |
| run-b-coordinated-v5 | quick, concurrency 2 | true | **llm** | **14.1%** pass (74/525), **2 real scope violations**, 1/3 tasks done, 350 LOC, ~19 min |
| run-b-coordinated-v4-retry | quick, concurrency 2 | true | llm | **INVALID** — argv 8191-char limit killed coordinated worker spawn; lockfile false-positive scope violations |
| run-b-coordinated-v4 | quick, concurrency 2 | true | seed | **INVALID** — cursor-agent auth expired mid-session |

Compare v4 A vs v3 A: `npm run compare -- runs/run-a-bare-v4/metrics.json runs/run-a-bare-v3/metrics.json` (+4.6pp pass rate with LLM planner).

### v5 finding: planner-induced scope conflict

In run-b-coordinated-v5 the planner put `src/blocks/index.ts` in task-01's scope only, yet task-02/03 notes said "Register in blocks/index.ts". Workers followed the notes, touched the out-of-scope integration file, and both merges were rejected. Genuine coordination-design lesson: **disjoint file scopes need an owned integration point** (a wiring task or merger step), otherwise the planner's own instructions create violations.

### Harness fixes (2026-07-24, after v4-retry)

- `runner.mjs`: prompt now passed via **stdin** (was argv → Windows cmd.exe 8191-char limit broke coordinated workers + all reviewers).
- `checkScopeViolation`: exempts `package-lock.json` / `npm-shrinkwrap.json` / `dist/` (build side effects, not code edits).

## Runs (2026-07-23) — seed planner (legacy)

| Run ID | Mode | Coordination | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| run-a-serial-quick | serial, 3 tasks | false | 28.8% pass, 0 merge/scope issues, 451 LOC, planner=seed |
| run-a-bare-v3 | quick, concurrency 2 | false | 19.6% pass, 0 merge conflicts, 440 LOC, 3/3 tasks done |
| run-b-coordinated-v3 | quick, concurrency 2 | true | 19.6% pass, **1 scope violation** (task-02 failed), 195 LOC, 2/3 tasks done, GUIDE.md populated |

Legacy failed runs (`run-a-bare`, `run-a-bare-v2`) had 0% pass due to missing post-merge build — superseded by v3.

## Interpretation

- Compare **merge_conflicts** vs **scope_violations** separately in `metrics.json`.
- Run B matched pass rate but **lost task-02 merge** (scope enforcement); use `tasks_done` and LOC, not pass rate alone.
